I have object detection models (2 models) for PPE detection and Face recognition. now I need to use two cameras to connect each model. this mean each model must received video feed from two cameras.  we need to deploy this project in our server. we need to deploy this implementation in docker container for portability. how do you think how to deploy it. we need also to implement the process in deep implementation. for example we don't need bug, if a camera don't work fine this must not bloc other process or cameras.  for now we use 6 Go RAM GPU. this resources must be shared to all process we implement. each process must work independently  to others. no sequential process. how to implement it
